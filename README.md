# Fillable Canteens HARDCORE
Overhauls Fillable Canteens to fit GAMMA's difficulty and balance. I made this because, while I like the idea, I think the original mod is too generous for GAMMA playthroughs.

## What this mod changes (vs. Fillable Canteens):
- It turns dirty, boiled, and purified water into a progression system: you have to collect dirty water, then boil it, then add a purification tablet to make it 100% safe for drinking.
- Dirty water now gets boiled through the cooking UI and requires a cooking kit use. (You can still choose to use Campfire Roasting instead, in which case the included patch adjusts base costs and weights to compensate).
- Traders no longer sell flasks (unless using "Tourist" economy). You get one in your starting loadout, and the rest you have to find in the world (you can opt out of this in MCM).
- Dynamic item spawns for flasks are now much rarer.
- Traders only sell 1 bottle of purification tablets at most per restock (unless using "Tourist" economy).
- Rare dynamic item spawns for purification tablets are added.
- Max uses for flasks are lowered to 5 and thirst reduction is reduced back to ~900 per full canteen.
- Purification tablets now have a base cost of 1112 for 3 uses (or 1978 if you choose Campfire Roasting). At these prices the total cost to boil and purify water is about the same as buying a flask used to be.
- Dirty and boiled water give significant radiation, hunger, and sleepiness debuffs, but both are usable if in a bind.
- Cooking meals with water now gives an empty canteen when used up.
- Adds color indicators to canteen icons to convey the type of water in them.
- Optional camo-style icons for canteens.
- Recolors purification tablets to be more similar to canteens and less similar to other medication (like Ibuprofen).
- Fixes the water pump's map icon.
- MCM settings to control icon style, indicator visiblity, purification pill colorization, and trader stock.
- Monkey-patched and tested to be compatible with other popular icon packs and mods.

## Installation
  1. Install Fillable Canteens with MO2: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/fillable-canteens-20
    1. Tick/Untick "Water Pumps" to your preference (water pumps distribute dirty water at certain locations).
    2. Only tick "Campfire Roasting" if you prefer to use that instead of the cooking UI to boil water and cook low-tier meat.

  2. Install Fillable Canteens HARDCORE:
    1. If you ticked "Campfire Roasting" in the previous step, also tick "01 Patch for Campfire Roasting" to enable the correct price/weight settings.
    2. Put this below (higher priority than) Fillable Canteens.
