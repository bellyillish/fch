Re-tunes Fillable Canteens to better fit GAMMA's balance. I made this because, while I like the idea, I think the original mod is a little too generous for GAMMA playthroughs.

## What this mod changes (vs. Fillable Canteens):
- It turns dirty->boiled->purified water into a progression: you have to collect dirty water, then boil it, then add a purification tablet to make it 100% safe for drinking.
- To boil water, you can either use the Campfire Roasting feature bundled with Fillable Canteens, or instead you can use the built-in cooking UI which requires a cooking kit use. Item prices and weights get adjusted to match which boiling option you choose.
- Lowers canteen max use to 5 and reduces thirst reduction back to ~900 per full canteen.
- Purification tablets have a base cost of 1470 for 3 uses (or 604 if using the cooking UI option). For both options, purifying 3 canteens is about 500 RU cheaper than buying 3 canteens.
- Dirty and boiled water give significant radiation, hunger, and sleepiness debuffs while remaining viable when in a bind.
- Bottled water is untouched and remains a higher-tier item with it's increased thirst reduction and beter buffs.
- Cooking with water now gives an empty canteen when used up.
- Adds color indicators to canteen icons to convey the type of water in them
- Optional camo-style icons for canteens.
- Recolors purification tablets to be more similar to canteens and less similar to other medication (like Ibuprofen).
- Fixes the water pump's map icon.
- MCM settings to control icon style, indicator visiblity, and purification pill colorization.
- Monkey-patched and tested to be compatible with other popular icon packs and mods.

The cost reduction vs. buying water is modest and you probably won't care aside from the very early game. But the real purpose is to allow you to be self-sufficient for water like you can be with food when in the field, while staying faithful to GAMMA's difficulty and balance.

## Installation
  1. Install Fillable Canteens with MO2: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/fillable-canteens-20
    1. Tick/untick "Campfire Roasting" to your preference (it lets you roast low-tier meat directly in a fire, and is one of two options for boiling water).
    2. Tick/Untick "Water Pumps" to your preference (water pumps distribute dirty water at certain bases).

  2. Install Fillable Canteens GAMMAfier:
    1. If you ticked "Campfire Roasting" in the previous step, also tick "01 Patch for Campfire Roasting" to enable the correct price/weight settings.
    2. Put this below (higher priority than) Fillable Canteens.
